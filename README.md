Hi, I'm Ingyu Jang!


In 1687, 아이작 뉴턴 published the work that had a major impact on a understanding of the world, the universe even.
It contained his three laws of motion. We've already covered the first two laws in detail. 
So, this morning I want to produce the third law which is what happens when force is exerted on an object.
What exactly does Newton's third law of motion say?
Well... It states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
I'm sure most of you have heard this before, but have you ever really considered what it means?
In a nut shell, Newton believed that when two objects interact, they exert exactly the same man force on each other, just in opposite directions. 
Ok, I can see some confused looks out there.
Let's try this.
Many of you have probably played baseball, or at least watched the game.
When a play hits the ball with the bat, force is being applied to the ball, right?
But it may surprise you to learn that the bat is being subjected to the exact same amount of force from the ball.
This is what is known as an action reaction force pair.
In addition, Newton said that force can never be applied in isolation.
It always involve two objects exerting equal amount of force on each other.
Of course, this leads to the obvious question.
How can one object move another?
I mean if both apply the same force to each other, there shouldn't be any motion at all, right?

I mean if both apply the same force to each other, there shouldn't be any motion at all, right?
Umm... that is actually a common misconception that the equal and opposing action some how cancel each other out.
However, what you need to realize is that the object involved in action reaction force pair usually have different characteristics, size, shape, mass.
You get the idea.
This means that they do not respond in the same way to the force involved in the interaction.
For instance, the baseball and bat I mentioned earlier are clearly very different.
Therefore, they respond differently to the same amount of force.
The ball goes fly out in to the field, while the swing of the bat is slowed slightly.
Ok
