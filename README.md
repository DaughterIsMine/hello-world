Hi, I'm Ingyu Jang!


I'm pretty sure you know that animals are capable of camoflouging themselves so that they escape detection.
You can probably name a few right up the back.
S: The cameleon changes colors, and a lot of other animals can take on the color of their surroundings.
P: Good! But is that all?
S: Or you know there natural coloring allows them to blend in, like dear and many kinds of insects.
And some animal actually looks like other objects or even other animals.
P: Ok! That last when you mentioned is what I'm interested in, animals that mimic.
S: Yeah! Like the deadleaf butterfly. When its wings are folded up, they looks exactly like dead leaves.
P: That is certainly one example. Let some animals go further, and one in particular is the true master of this guys.
I'm talking about the octopus.
Most spieces of octopus can alter their color, shape, size, and in some cases even the texture of their skins.
Today, I want to talk about the biological mechanism that allow them to do this.
When it comes to changing color, the octopus can choose on almost unlimited palid of shades of hues and can switch color increadibly quickly, literary in a blink of an eye.
It blends into background so perfectly that it would take a diliberate search to find it.
So how was this possible?
Octopus posseses special skin cell, called a chrometalforce. 
These are pigment containg a light reflecting cells.
They are commonly found in amphibians, fishs, reptiles, and 세플리파이즈, the classifications to which all species of octopus belong.
Now, while this kind of cells are fairly in the animal kingdom, those found in the skin of an octopus are unique.
There are structure in such a way that the octopus can move the pigment around.
The process is called physiological color change and an octopus simply use its muscle to achieve this.
Each chorometry for cell contains three malleable compartments.
By squizing or expending each compartment, an octopus can change the color display by the cell even allowing millions of settle combination.
Since all cells are controled seperately, it can creat remarkably clear and detail displays. 
In fact, this is further enhanced by the presence of a reflective coating under each of the cell.
So, chaning color is one thing, I mean lots of other animals can do this too, the cameleon for one, as susan mentioned, the octopus just does it better. 
However, octopus can also radically transfer not only their shape, their size as well. 
Sounds like something from science fiction movie, right?
It is true though, just imagine!
And octopus with an are span 30cm, that is about a foot long, is able to reduce its proportions and squiz through a hole less than a quarter of their normal body shape.
One octopus in captivity was even able to force himself into manage jar.
In order to understand how an octopus is able to do this, we need to first know a little about its physical structure.
Hmm... It is may be a bit of a review for some of you, but the... well... bear with me.
The octopus's eight arms don't actually have any tenticle.
These arms are refered to as a muscular hydrostate by biologist mainly because their strength and rigidity is acieved solely through the compression of muscles.
This is because the body of the octopus is composed almost entirely of soft tissue.
It doesn't have an internal skeleton.
There is no protective shells, nor does it have any cardlish.
In fact, the only hard part of an octopus is its beak which resembles a parrets beak and functions in much the same way.
One particular spieces of octopus, the mimic octopus, is able to use this shape shifting ability to imitate other species.
It can mimic 17 different species found in its habitat.
As most these are poisonous it is proved to be a great defence strategy for the octopus.
Does anyone know what some of this poisonous species are?
S: I have read that it can conflaten itself to look like the poisonous soul of even use its arms to mimic a lion fish which has vanomous fins.
P: Right! And you can be sure predeters will go out of their way to avoid them.
And their skin texture as well.
Normally the skin of an octopus is very smooth. 
This could proved to be disadvantages if it was trying to blend in with a piece of coral with the very rough surface.
However, by distincting small sections of skin and using color shading to enhence the effect, the octopus can make the texture of it skin resemble almost anything, in some cases even plants.
S: I have seen pictures of these octopus is mimicing various things.
Umm... Like sea snakes and even rocks.
But I'm really interested in that inc jet I read about. 
Octopuses can creat an inc cloud to hide themselves.
P: Yes, it is pretty amazing. They also know a weapons an octopus has.
S: It sort of like at last resolve when a predetor identifies the octopus 
The octopus releases inc in a cloud, sometimes even shutting a stream of it into the face of the predetor.
P: And this is what makes the octopus a true escaper.
That inc contains a substance that affects the or factory organs of the predetors, so that it can't use its sense of smell to locate the escaping octopus.
